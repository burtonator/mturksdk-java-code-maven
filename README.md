mturksdk-java-code-maven
========================

Maven support for mturksdk-java-code

Overview
========

The mturksdk-java-code project implements SOAP/WSDL bindings for Amazon Mechanical Turk.

The only downside is that there aren't maven packages for it.

This project implements maven packages and allows you to install them.

It's not perfect, but I didn't want to have to do a complete rework of their packages.

Just run build.sh to build it and install it in your local repository.
